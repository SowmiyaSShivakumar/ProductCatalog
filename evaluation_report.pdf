Actionable Recommendations
1. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Review data fetching methods and apply lazy loading for efficiency.
2. **Convert to Asynchronous Processing**: Refactor synchronous methods that can leverage asynchronous execution.
3. **Null Handling**: Modify methods to prevent null returns by using empty collections or throwing exceptions.
4. **Separate Business Logic**: Move business logic out of controllers and into the service layer.
5. **Stateless Controllers**: Ensure controllers do not hold state to enhance scalability.
6. **Standardize Code Formatting**: Follow Google Java Style guides for consistent code formatting.
7. **Limit Comments**: Keep comments to a minimum, focusing only on necessary clarifications.
8. **Externalize Configurations**: Keep sensitive configurations outside of the codebase using environment variables.
9. **Optimize Control Flow**: Use ternary operators where appropriate to simplify control flows.
10. **Manage Dependencies**: Regularly check `pom.xml` for unused libraries and remove them.
11. **Organize Code Structure**: Refactor the codebase to improve separation of concerns.
12. **Establish CI/CD Practices**: Implement continuous integration and deployment for smoother releases.
13. **Implement Security Logging**: Enable audit logging where necessary for security-sensitive actions.
