## 2. Logging and Auditing Evaluation Report 

### 2.1. Adherence Scores

| Guideline                         | Adherence Score (1-5) | Deviations Found                                           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Logging Levels                 | 2                      | Inconsistent use of logging levels throughout the codebase |
| 2. Log Message Formats            | 3                      | Log messages are sometimes vague and non-informative       |

| `src/logger.js`                  | Inconsistent logging levels                            | Standardize logging levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)     |
| `src/helpers.js`                 | Log messages are vague                                 | Improve log message clarity and detail               |

| `src/errorHandler.js`           | Exceptions logged with limited context                 | Include stack traces and contextual information      |
| `src/performance.js`             | Minimal logging of performance metrics                 | Introduce comprehensive performance logging          |

### 2.3. Actionable Suggestions

- Establish a clear strategy for logging levels and standardize log message formats.
- Develop an audit mechanism for tracking critical user actions.
- Ensure all exceptions provide adequate context and improve performance monitoring.

### 2.4. Summary

The repository displays a significant need for enhancement in logging and auditing practices. Proposed changes will improve traceability, monitoring capabilities, and overall reliability.
