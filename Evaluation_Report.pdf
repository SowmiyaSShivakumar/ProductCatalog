## Detailed Evaluation Breakdown

### Design Best Practices  
| Aspect                  | Score | Remarks on Deviations                                                                                                       |  
|------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Modularity              | 75    | Controllers are handling too many responsibilities, violating the single responsibility principle.                          |  
| Readability             | 75    | Method names are inconsistent (mix of snake_case and camelCase).                                                            |  
| Maintainability         | 75    | Service methods have deeply nested logic, making maintenance challenging.                                                   |  
| Documentation           | 70    | Insufficient documentation explaining project setup and usage.                                                              |  

### Development Best Practices  
| Aspect                  | Score | Remarks on Deviations                                                                                                       |  
|------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Modularity              | 75    | Similar to design; requires refactoring for small, modular components.                                                      |  
| Readability             | 75    | Consistency in naming conventions must be enforced (use of snake_case preferred).                                            |  
| Maintainability         | 75    | Complex methods need simplification to ensure clarity and ease of maintenance.                                              |  
| Documentation           | 70    | README requires updates with setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.                               |  
| Testing                 | 60    | No unit tests to validate functionalities and business logic.                                                               |  

### Security Best Practices  
| Aspect                  | Score | Remarks on Deviations                                                                                                       |  
|------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Modularity              | 75    | Need to adhere to single responsibility principle for better security practices.                                            |  
| Readability             | 75    | Same issues with naming conventions persist.                                                                                 |  
| Maintainability         | 75    | Deeply nested logic can hide security vulnerabilities; simpler code is easier to audit and secure.                           |  
| Documentation           | 70    | Security practices in documentation are lacking; must include security-specific setup and guidelines.                       |  
| Testing                 | 60    | Critical components lack necessary unit tests to ensure security against vulnerabilities.                                     |

## Recommendations  
1. **Modular Design**: Refactor controllers into smaller units that comply with the single responsibility principle, enhancing modularity and maintainability.
2. **Consistency in Naming**: Standardize naming conventions throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.
3. **Simplifying Logic**: Focus on reducing complexity in service methods; break larger functions into smaller, reusable components.
4. **Documentation Enhancements**: Revise the README and internal documentation to offer comprehensive guides for project setup, usage, and security practices.
5. **Increased Testing Coverage**: Implement unit tests for key functionalities, aiming for higher test coverage to secure the code against vulnerabilities.
