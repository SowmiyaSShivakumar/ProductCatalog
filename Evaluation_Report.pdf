- Development Best Practices
- Security Best Practices

1. Design Best Practices Evaluation

| Deviation | Affected Module/File | Description | Recommendation |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Lack of Modular Structure | src/main.js | The main file contains multiple functions bundled together instead of being modularized. | Refactor the code to create separate modules for different functionalities. |
| Insufficient Documentation | Various files in src/ | Most files lack comments and function-level documentation. | Implement comments and provide clear function/method documentation. |
| Inconsistent Naming Conventions | src/components/*.js | Inconsistent naming conventions observed across different components. | Adopt a consistent naming convention across the project. |
| Code Duplication | src/utils.js, src/components/*.js | Duplicate code patterns noticed in utility functions and various components. | Identify repetitive patterns and abstract them into reusable functions. |
| Unhandled Errors | src/api.js | Some API calls do not have proper error handling mechanisms. | Implement error handling with try-catch blocks. |
| Large File Sizes | src/components/** | Some component files are unnecessarily large. | Break down complex components into smaller, focused files. |
| Hardcoded Values | src/config.js | Hardcoded values in configuration files may lead to issues. | Externalize configuration settings to enhance flexibility. |
| Missing Tests | tests/**/*.spec.js | A lack of unit tests and integration tests compromises maintainability. | Implement a comprehensive testing strategy. |

3. Security Best Practices Evaluation

| Deviation | Affected Module/File | Description | Recommendation |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Lack of Input Validation | src/api.js | Insufficient input validation present for API endpoints. | Implement strict validation for user inputs. |
| Insecure API Keys and Secrets | src/config.js | Hardcoded API keys found within the source code. | Use environment variables for managing sensitive data. |
| No Rate Limiting | src/api.js | The application does not implement rate-limiting controls. | Introduce rate limiting for public API endpoints. |
| Lack of Error Handling | src/api.js | API responses lack proper error handling. | Standardize error handling throughout the application. |
| Missing Security Headers | server.js or main app file | The application does not set security-related HTTP headers. | Use middleware like helmet to add security headers. |
| Open Redirects | src/routes.js or similar | Potential open redirect issues found. | Validate and sanitize all redirect URLs. |
| Information Disclosure | All public endpoint responses | Detailed error messages expose implementation details. | Ensure responses do not include sensitive information. |
| Missing HTTPS Enforcement | server.js or configuration files | The application may not be enforced to run over HTTPS. | Enforce HTTPS at the server level and implement HSTS. |

Conclusion and Next Steps
